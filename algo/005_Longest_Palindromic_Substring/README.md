### 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S. You may assume that the maximum length of S is 1000, and there exists one unique longest palindromic substring.

### Analysis
From the center to extend the substring to check whether it is a Palindrome.
It has two situations: one is the substring length is odd, one is the substring length is even
